# GoBarber Web

This is the code for the GoBarber Web. [Click here](https://github.com/felipemmendes/gostack11-gobarber-backend) to check out the code for the server, and [here](https://github.com/felipemmendes/gostack11-gobarber-mobile) to check out the code for the mobile app.

This project was made during Rocketseat's [GoStack Bootcamp](https://pages.rocketseat.com.br/gostack).

## What is GoBarber?

GoBarber is a barbershop app that allows barbers and customers to schedule and manage appointments.

## Features

- Sign in, sign up and password recovery pages
- Barber dashboard page
- Edit profile page

## Getting Started

To run the server you will need npm or yarn installed in your computer. Also, you will need to run the [GoBarber Server](https://github.com/felipemmendes/gostack11-gobarber-backend).

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/felipemmendes/gostack11-gobarber-frontend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Edit the file with your own configuration

4. Start the server in development mode

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

5. `npm run build` or `yarn build` will create a `build` folder, which contains the compiled version (the .js version) of the code.

### Aditional notes

You can run the tests I've written (still not finished) with `npm run test` or `yarn test`.
